# About Me

Hi! I am an Assistant Professor at [Columbia Business School](https://home.gsb.columbia.edu/) in the [Decision, Risk, and Operations](https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/faculty-research/divisions/decision-risk-operations) division and a member of the [Data Science Institute](https://datascience.columbia.edu/).

Previously, I received my PhD in Operations Research from Stanford University, where I was affiliated with the [Operations Research](https://or.stanford.edu/) group in MS&E and the [Society and Algorithms Lab](https://soal.stanford.edu/) and was a postdoctoral associate at MIT. I graduated from Pomona College with a degree in mathematics. 


# Research Interests

My research develops data science methods tailored to social systems, such as online marketplaces, education systems, social media, and digital health platforms. In particular, I focus on experimentation, recommendation systems, and early warning systems. 

My work combines interdisciplinary approaches from operations research, statistics, causal inference, and economics to develop practical solutions with theoretical guarantees. I inform my research with collaborations and first hand experience working with these platforms.
